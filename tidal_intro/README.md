## What is Live Coding?


- Live i.e. performed
- Coding i.e. programming
- Usually music
- Typically performed with a PA and projected code
- Sometimes solo, sometimes ensemble
- Sometimes with live-coded graphics
- Perhaps niche/nerdy but definite [community](https://blog.toplap.org/)



## Live Coding Languages for Music

- [ChucK (C-ish)](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/)
- [Supercollider (smalltalk)](https://supercollider.github.io/)
- [SonicPi (ruby)](https://sonic-pi.net/)
- [Orca (???)](https://100r.co/site/orca.html)
- [Tidal Cycles (haskell)](https://tidalcycles.org/)
- [Strudel (JS)](https://strudel.cc/)
- [Foxdot/Renaldo (python)](https://github.com/e-lie/renardo)


## Starting with Tidal

- Install
- Start SuperCollider
- Environment: VSC .tidal extension
- First sound: execute with ctrl-enter

``` d1 $ sound "bd"```

- Stop with `hush` (and/or keyboard shortcut)
- See [workshop](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tutorials/workshop) and [video course](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tutorials/course1)


## (Slightly) Under the Hood

- Tidal sends OSC messages to SuperCollider
- Ask SuperCollider to show OSC messages ```s.dumpOSC(1)```
- See what happens when you ask for a non-existent sound
- List of samples in [Default library](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/configuration/AudioSamples/default_library/)
- `d1` is the first of 16 numbered functions which send the parameter to audio
- `$` is for function application with brackets


## Sequencing sounds

- Nearly all strings are sequencable
- Sounds are spaced evenly over a cycle
- Some samples have more than one variant, select with colon e.g.

``` d1 $ sound "bd 808:3"```

- Set cycles per second with e.g. 

```setcps 0.6```


## Functions on Patterns

- A pattern is a function from time to value
- Patterns can be transformed with (higher-order) functions

```d2 $ fast 3 $ sound "blip"```

- Pattern transformation functions include: [slow](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/time/#speeding-up-slowing-down); [brak](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/concatenation/#brak); [degrade](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/alteration/#degrade)
- See [Tidal reference](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/cycles) for many more
- Pattern transformations can be applied selectively: [every](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/conditions/#every); [sometimes](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/randomness/#the-sometimes-family)


## Mini-notation and Combining Patterns

- Some pattern functions have shorthand in [mini-notation](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/mini_notation)
- Interesting ones include Euclidean and polymetric patternms
- Add multiple simultaneous "tracks" by having d1, d2 etc
- Sequence more than one property at once e.g. sample number

```d1 $ s "808" # n "[1 2 3 4 5]/6"```

- `#` is shorthand for `|>` taking structure from left
- [Other ways of combining structure](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/pattern_structure)


## Other stuff

- [Continuous patterns/oscillators](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/oscillators)
- [Synthesisers](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/synthesizers)
- [Audio effects](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/audio_effects)
- [Transitions](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/transitions)
- [State](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/state_values)
- [Scales](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/harmony_melody)
- [Samplers](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/samplers) and [Sampling](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/sampling)
