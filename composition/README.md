## What makes a piece of music?

Using natural language to explain a piece of music, what kind of things would you describe?


## The people said



Using computational processes to analyse or generate a piece of music, what kind of outputs would you get?


## The people said



If you were given a natural language description or computational output, what would be left to decide?


## Starting material

- Take existing music, analyse it and create something with the same high-level structure e.g. form, development of texture, harmonic tempo

- Take existing music and extract small-scale content e.g. melody, chords, rhythm, samples and develop/overlay them

- Use other data sources e.g. text, DNA sequences, images, random numbers and map them to musical characteristics


## Development

- Serialism and counterpoint: 
  - inversion ([mul(-1)](https://strudel.cc/functions/value-modifiers/#mul))
  - retrograde ([rev](https://strudel.cc/learn/time-modifiers/#rev))
  - canon ([late](https://strudel.cc/learn/time-modifiers/#late))
  - metrical canon ([slow](https://strudel.cc/learn/time-modifiers/#slow))
- Augmentation: make (some) notes longer; make (some) intervals wider. Diminution


- Remapping: change scale or time signature
- Phasing and other polymetric techniques
- Harmonization: functional harmony and substitution; harmonic planing; tintinnabulation; 
- Polymeters and polychords

Not too much: simple is often good e.g. repeat up an octave

- [arrange](https://strudel.cc/learn/factories/#arrange)

## Compositional processes

- Start with some high-level or low-level symbolic material and develop it

- OR start with some audio e.g. sample, instrument(s), chord, texture

- OR start with a technique you want to use e.g. tintinnabulation, phasing, scalar mapping


- OR start with something conceptual you want to write about e.g. free speech

- OR start with a set of constraints e.g. 5/4 mixolydian mode, write it in 20 minutes. See [suggestions.py](./suggestions)


### In all cases

- Record ideas when you have them (text or audio)
- Experiment: do random things; make mistakes; improvise
- Refine: change; add; remove
- Reflect
- Work on one thing at a time e.g. sound design; melody; harmony; structure

You are more likely to produce good stuff if you produce a lot of stuff
